JaMoveo App Description

JaMoveo is a full‑stack web application built to enhance band rehearsals by enabling real‑time collaboration and song sharing among members. The app presents a modern, phone music player–inspired design where visitors begin at a home page. By clicking “Start,” users are directed to sign up or log in. Once authenticated, a side menu (burger menu) provides role-based navigation—regular users access the Player page, while administrators have access to dedicated pages such as Admin and Results.

The application uses a static JSON file as its songs database. When an admin selects a song from the search results, the song’s chords and lyrics are broadcast in real time via Socket.IO. The live session intelligently displays content: vocalists see only the lyrics, whereas other musicians see both chords and lyrics.

The client is built with React and deployed on Vercel, and the server (using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO) is hosted on Railway. Together, these technologies deliver a responsive, interactive, and visually engaging experience that can be easily shared with band members and collaborators.
